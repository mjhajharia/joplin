# probability theory and mcmc background

A set $C \in \mathcal{B}(\mathrm{X})$ is called a small set if there exists an $m>0$, and a non-trivial measure $\nu\_m$ on $\mathcal{B}(\mathrm{X})$, such that for all $x \in C, B \in \mathcal{B}(\mathrm{X})$,

$$
P^m(x, B) \geq \nu\_m(B)
$$

When this holds we say that $C$ is $\nu\_m$-small.

(from 5.2 in \cite{meyn2012markov})

An irreducible chain on a countable space $X$ is called
(i) aperiodic, if $d(x) \equiv 1, x \in \mathrm{X}$;
(ii) strongly aperiodic, if $P(x, x)>0$ for some $x \in \mathrm{X}$.

(from 5.4.2 in  \cite{meyn2012markov})

We will call a set $C \in \mathcal{B}(\mathrm{X}) \nu\_a$-petite if the sampled chain satisfies the bound

$$
K\_a(x, B) \geq \nu\_a(B)
$$

for all $x \in C, B \in \mathcal{B}(\mathrm{X})$, where $\nu\_a$ is a non-trivial measure on $\mathcal{B}(\mathrm{X})$.
(from 5.5.2 in  \cite{meyn2012markov})

(Proposition 4.2.1. \cite{meyn2012markov}) The following are equivalent formulations of $\varphi$-irreducibility:
(i) for all $x \in \mathrm{X}$, whenever $\varphi(A)>0, U(x, A)>0$;
(ii) for all $x \in \mathrm{X}$, whenever $\varphi(A)>0$, there exists some $n>0$, possibly depending on both $A$ and $x$, such that $P^n(x, A)>0$;
(iii) for all $x \in \mathrm{X}$, whenever $\varphi(A)>0$ then $K\_{a\_{\frac{1}{2}}}(x, A)>0$.

$\psi$-Irreducibility notation
(i) The Markov chain is called $\psi$-irreducible if it is $\varphi$-irreducible for some $\varphi$ and the measure $\psi$ is a maximal irreducibility measure satisfying the conditions of Proposition 4.2.2.
(ii) We write

$$
\mathcal{B}^{+}(\mathrm{X}):={A \in \mathcal{B}(\mathrm{X}): \psi(A)>0}
$$

for the sets of positive $\psi$-measure; the equivalence of maximal irreducibility measures means that $\mathcal{B}^{+}(\mathrm{X})$ is uniquely defined.
(iii) We call a set $A \in \mathcal{B}(\mathrm{X})$ full if $\psi\left(A^c\right)=0$.
(iv) We call a set $A \in \mathcal{B}(\mathrm{X})$ absorbing if $P(x, A)=1$ for $x \in A$.

we will  get $\mu^{\mathrm{Leb}}$-irreducibility, where $\mu^{\mathrm{Leb}}$ is Lebesgue measure

more details of mcmc theory that is related see \cite{roberts1998markov}

The state space is denoted by $\mathcal{X} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^k$, equipped with the Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathscr{B}$. All distributions, including $\pi(x)$ and transition densities$q(x, y)$, are defined with respect to the Lebesgue measure $\mu^{\text{Leb}}$.

Proposal Kernel: A candidate transition is proposed from $x \in \mathcal{X}$ to $y \in \mathcal{X}$ according to a proposal density $q(x, y)$, where $q(x, \cdot)$ is the conditional density for generating proposals given the current state $x$.

The actual transition kernel $P(x, A)$, which governs the evolution of the Markov chain, is defined by:
$$
P(x, A) = \int\_A p(x, y) , \mathrm{d}y + \delta\_x(A) r(x),
$$
where:
-$p(x, y) = q(x, y) \alpha(x, y)$ is the transition density for $y \neq x$,
-$r(x) = \int q(x, y) \[1 - \alpha(x, y)] , \mathrm{d}y$ is the probability of remaining at $x$,
-and $\delta\_x(A)$ is the Dirac delta measure, assigning all mass to the point $x$.

Stationary Distribution: The Markov chain is designed to satisfy detailed balance, ensuring that $\pi(x)$ is invariant:
$$
\pi(A) = \int\_\mathcal{X} \pi(x) P(x, A) , \mathrm{d}x, \quad \forall A \in \mathscr{B}.
$$

Convergence in Distribution: Let $P^n(x, A)$ denote the $n$-step transition probabilities of the Markov chain, defined as:
$$
P^n(x, A) = P(\Phi\_n \in A \mid \Phi\_0 = x), \quad x \in \mathcal{X}, A \in \mathscr{B}.
$$
Under suitable irreducibility and aperiodicity conditions, it holds that:
$$
|P^n(x, \cdot) - \pi|*{\text{TV}} \to 0 \quad \text{as } n \to \infty,
$$
for $\pi$-almost (holds outside every null set) all $x$. Here, the total variation distance is defined as:
$$
|P^n(x, \cdot) - \pi|*{\text{TV}} := \frac{1}{2} \sup\_{A \in \mathscr{B}} \left| P^n(x, A) - \pi(A) \right|.
$$
