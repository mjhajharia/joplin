# discretization langevin

In discrete time, we usually want to use a step size $\eta$ to construct an iterative update rule for the discretization.

## Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA)

Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA) is a simple discretization of the Langevin diffusion:
$$
X\_{k+1} = X\_k - \eta \nabla f(X\_k) + \sqrt{2\eta} \zeta\_k,
$$
where $\eta > 0$ is the step size and $\zeta\_k \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$ are independent Gaussian random variables. The drift term $\eta \nabla f(X\_k)$ introduces bias; for any fixed $\eta > 0$, the law $\rho\_k$ of $X\_k$ converges to a limiting distribution $\nu\_\eta$, which differs from the true target $\nu$.

While, ULA can approximate sampling using a small stepsize to keep the bias within acceptable thresholds (\cite{dalalyan2017}, and \cite{durmus\_non-asymptotic\_2016} it is asymptotically biased due to its discretization structure being forward-flow and not the true gradient descent in the space of measures.

## Underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo

ULMC incorporates momentum to address ULA's slow mixing, allowing the particle to retain velocity across steps. The second order SDE is defined as:
$$
\begin{aligned}
d X\_t & =V\_t dt\\
d V\_t & =-\gamma V\_t dt- \nabla f(X\_t) d t+(\sqrt{2 \gamma}) d B\_t
\end{aligned}
$$
where $\gamma \ge 0$ is the friction coefficient and $V\_t$ represents velocity.
