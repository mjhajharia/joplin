#### riemannian metric tensor

The SDE for the underdamped Langevin dynamics is modified to incorporate anisotropic smoothness through a position-dependent metric tensor:
$$
dX\_t = -G(x)^{-1} \nabla U(x) , dt + \sqrt{2G(x)^{-1}} , dB\_t,
$$
where $G(x) \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ is a positive definite metric tensor, such as $G(x) = \nabla^2 U(x) + \epsilon I$ with regularization parameter $\epsilon > 0$.

Discretization of the SDE using the Euler-Maruyama method yields:
$$
X\_{k+1} = X\_k - \eta G(X\_k)^{-1} \nabla U(X\_k) + \sqrt{2\eta G(X\_k)^{-1}} , \xi\_k,
$$
where $\eta > 0$ is the step size, and $\xi\_k \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$.

#### multiscale time-stepping

Let $U(x)$ decompose as $U(x) = U\_s(x) + U\_f(x)$, where $U\_s(x)$ and $U\_f(x)$ represent smooth and stiff components, respectively. The dynamics are given by:
$$
\begin{aligned}
dX\_t &= -\nabla U\_s(X\_t) , dt - \nabla U\_f(X\_t) , dt + \sqrt{2} , dB\_t.
\end{aligned}
$$

The multiscale scheme alternates between resolving $U\_s(x)$ with a larger step size $\eta\_s$ and $U\_f(x)$ with a smaller step size $\eta\_f$, where $\eta\_s \gg \eta\_f$. The discretization becomes:
$$
\begin{aligned}
X\_{k+1/2} &= X\_k - \eta\_s \nabla U\_s(X\_k), \\
X\_{k+1} &= X\_{k+1/2} - \eta\_f \nabla U\_f(X\_{k+1/2}) + \sqrt{2\eta\_f} , \xi\_k.
\end{aligned}
$$
