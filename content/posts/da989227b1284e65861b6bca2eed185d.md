# defective lsi

the point of this exposition is thinking about the log-sobolev inequality in situations where you have high probability guarantees that the conditions for LSI are met. does this mean exponential convergence is still guaranteed? can we guarantee exponential convergence with an additive term?

(for some background see jordan 1998 and tweedie 1996)
