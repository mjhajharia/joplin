# wgf or wasserstein gradient flows

The Langevin diffusion and the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA) can be interpreted as gradient flow dynamics minimizing the relative entropy (KL divergence) over the space of probability measures \cite{jordan\_variational\_1998}. Specifically, the marginal distribution of the Langevin diffusion process $(X\_t)*{t \geq 0}$ evolves along the gradient flow in the Wasserstein space, minimizing $D*{\mathrm{KL}}(\cdot | \pi)$ \cite{jordan\_variational\_1998, villani\_optimal\_2009}.

The space of probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with finite second moments is denoted as:
$$
\mathcal{P}*2\left(\mathbb{R}^d\right) = \left{\mu : \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}*{\geq 0} \mid \int\_{\mathbb{R}^d} \mu(x) , dx = 1 \right}.
$$
The distance between two measures $\mu, \nu \in \mathcal{P}*2\left(\mathbb{R}^d\right)$ is defined by the Wasserstein-2 distance \cite{villani\_optimal\_2009}:
$$
W\_2(\mu, \nu) = \left( \inf*{\Pi} \int d^2(x, y) , d\Pi(x, y) \right)^{\frac{1}{2}},
$$
subject to the marginal constraints:
$$
\int \Pi(x, y) , dy = \mu(x), \quad \int \Pi(x, y) , dx = \nu(y),
$$
where $d(x, y)$ is the Euclidean distance, and $\Pi$ is a joint distribution satisfying these constraints.

For a target distribution $\pi$ and a current distribution $\rho \in \mathcal{P}*2\left(\mathbb{R}^d\right)$, the gradient of the KL divergence with respect to $\rho$ is given by:
$$
\nabla*\rho D\_{\mathrm{KL}}(\rho | \pi) = \nabla \cdot \[\log \pi(x) \rho(x)] - \Delta \rho(x).
$$

A flow $\rho\_t$ in $\mathcal{P}\_2\left(\mathbb{R}^d\right)$ that satisfies:
$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \rho^t(x) = -\nabla \cdot \left\[\log \pi(x) \rho^t(x)\right] + \Delta \rho^t(x),
$$
is called the Wasserstein Gradient Flow (WGF), which minimizes the KL divergence with respect to the target distribution $\pi$.
