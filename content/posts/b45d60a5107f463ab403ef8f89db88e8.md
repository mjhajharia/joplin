# gradient flows

Langevin dynamics connects probability theory and optimization through its formulation as a gradient flow in the Wasserstein-2 space. The time evolution of the Fokker-Planck equation\cite{jordan\_variational\_1998} can be characterized as a gradient flow in the wasserstein space $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$, minimizing relative entropy $KL(p\_t || \pi)$ defined as:
$$
\frac{\partial p\_t}{\partial t} = - \nabla (p\_t F) + \Delta (p\_t)
$$

where $p\_t$ is the probability density at time $t$  and $F = - \nabla f$ represents drift and $\Delta(p\_t)$ is the diffusion term. Now, the relative entropy decreases over time due to entropy dissipation, given by:
$$
\frac{d}{d t} \mathrm{KL}\left(p\_t | \pi\right)=-\int \frac{\left|\nabla p\_t(x)\right|^2}{p\_t(x)} d x
$$

Gradient flow in the Wasserstein metric $W\_2$ can be expressed by the functional inequality:
$$
H\_v(p)=\frac{1}{2 p} \int \frac{|\nabla p(x)|^2}{p(x)} d x,
$$
where $H\_2(p)$ represents Fisher information relative to the target measure $v$.
This structure forms the basis for interpreting Langevin dynamics as the steepest descent flow in $\mathcal{P}\left(\mathbf{R}^n\right)$ towards $\pi$.
