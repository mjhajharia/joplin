      <description>Insofar as taste is concerned, for a while I have discerned it as something beyond arbitrary negation of notions to seek out specific narratives to live your life along. It reeks of history and effect far beyond that. The other day, in the most cliched way I was thinking of this with regards to politico-personal opinions. This was triggered by reading On, Women by Arthur Schopenhauer. Nothing surprising there, history is strewn with the wreckage of those who have minded beyond reason the lives of others, to paraphrase Woolf.</description>
